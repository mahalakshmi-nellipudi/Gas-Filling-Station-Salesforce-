# Gas-Filling-Station-Salesforce-
This project is a custom Salesforce CRM application designed to streamline operations at a gas filling station. It helps track fuel inventory, manage supplier deliveries, record buyer transactions, and automate billing calculations—all in one centralized system.

Built using four custom objects—Supplier, Gas Station, Fuel Details, and Buyer—the system supports automated fuel tracking through formula fields, roll-up summaries, and validation rules. It features a user-friendly Lightning interface with custom tabs, dynamic forms, and real-time reporting.
